TI Launchpad with MSP430(G2553, but may work on others with slight modifications)

LPD8806 RGB LED Strip array-mode control code
This version is intended to control arrays of LEDs made using rows of LPD8806-based strips joined at alternating ends:
>___________________      Legend:  > data input (start of strip)
 ___________________|              < data output (end of strip)
|___________________               | join between strips
<___________________|              _ LED strips

It uses a Microchip 23K256 32KB SRAM chip to store pixel data, to allow larger arrays to be used.  Connect as follows:
MSP430  23K256
 P2.1    pin 1 (CS)
 P2.2    pin 5 (SI)
 P2.3    pin 7 (HOLD)
 P2.4    pin 6 (SCK)
 P2.5    pin 2 (SO)
 GND     pin 4 (Vss)
 VCC     pin 8 (Vcc)

setPixel/setPixelS functions take col, row as first two params - 0,0 is top left, 1,0 is second pixel on top row, etc.
Defaults to 256 RGB LEDs in 16 rows and 16 cols - if you're working with different pixel dimensions and/or a different
number of LEDs, change the lines which reads "#define COLS 16" and "#define ROWS 16" to the relevant numbers.

SPI bit banged code to transfer 24 bit rgb/pwm data between external SRAM and LPD8806 strips.
