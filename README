LPD8806 RGB LED Strip array-mode control code
This version is intended to control arrays of LEDs made using rows of LPD8806-based strips joined at alternating ends:
>___________________      Legend:  > data input (start of strip)
 ___________________|              < data output (end of strip)
|___________________               | join between strips
<___________________|              _ LED strips

setPixel/setPixelS functions take col, row as first two params - 0,0 is top left, 1,0 is second pixel on top row, etc.
Defaults to 64 LEDs in 8 rows and 8 cols (64 total) - if you're working with different pixel dimensions and/or a different number of LEDs,
change the lines which reads "#define COLS 8" and "#define ROWS 8" to the relevant numbers.
